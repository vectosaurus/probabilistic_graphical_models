Some defintions 

<i>Joint Distributions</i>
The probability distribution that defines the simultaneous behavior of multiple random variables is the joint distribution of the thos random variables

<i>Conditioning</i>
The process of updating the probability distribution on making an observation. Helps in answering questions like, what are the chances that it will rain today given that the moisture laden winds are traveling east at 20 miles per hour 

<i>Marginalization</i>
Marginalization is an operation that takes a probability distribution over a larger subset of variables and produces a probability distribution over a subset of those

<i>Factor</i>
A factor really is a function, or a table. It takes a bunch of arguments and it gives us a value for every combination of values we provide it
